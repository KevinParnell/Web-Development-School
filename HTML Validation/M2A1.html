    <h1>Which Keyboard Is Right for You?</h1>
    <hr>
    <div><img src="keyboard.jpg" alt="Keyboard" width="480" height="294"></div>
    <p>Choosing a keyboard can be tough, especially for people who just started looking to use
        a keyboard other than the one that came with their computer. Without knowing what you're
        looking for, you may pick a keyboard that isn't right for you.
        Whether you're looking for a cheap keyboard or an expensive keyboard, there's one that will suit
        your needs and taste. It can be daunting looking at all the different options, but there's a few simple
        things to look for:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mechanical or membrane?</li>
        <li>Quiet or loud?</li>
        <li>Stiff or loose keys?</li>
        <li>Classy or flashy?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Choosing a membrane should be easy, and you might as well just stick with the one your
        computer came with (if it came with one). They are the most common keyboards found in stores
        and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_n_1?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A12879431%2Ck%3Akeyboard&keywords=keyboard&ie=UTF8&qid=1536811810&rnid=2941120011">online</a>,
        any should work unless you want a wireless one with good battery. Mechanical can be
        a bit more tricky though. It can be easy to get fooled by "mechanical feeling" keyboards, but those
        are just stiffer membrane keyboards. There's many brands out there, so the next configurations should pin down
        the best keyboard for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do you want a quiet keyboard or a loud keyboard? If you want a quiet keyboard, membrane just about guarantees
        that, although you can get some quiet mechanical that has Cherry MX reds or something equivalent from other
        manufacturers, such as razer. You could also opt in for a loud keyboard if you don't care about bothering your
        dog or
        coworkers. A common loud switch would be Cherry MX blues or equivalent. There's also a wide range of noise
        inbetween
        such as Romer-G keys from Logitech or other mechanical key switches from other manufactureers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step is to decide whether you want stiff or loose keys. Stiff keys require more actuation force to
        register,
        and they also tend to be louder, or you can opt for a keyboard with lower actuation force necessary to register
        keypresses but sacrifice more tactile feedback as well as audio feedback. As a general rule, the quieter the
        keyboard,
        the lower the actuation force required.
    </p>
    <p>
        Last but not least, it's time to choose a design for your new keyboard. At this point you've likely found a few
        keyboards
        that suit your needs, but now it's time to decide on aesthetic. A lot of mechanical keyboards tend to come with
        a gamer
        aesthetic which can be off putting to some people, or you can go with a classier more reserved design. It can
        be easy
        to determine which keyboard is gamer-y and flashy and which is more reserved. Flashy styles tend to use RGB
        LEDs as a
        backlight for the keycaps as well as have an edgy looking font on the keycaps. More reserved mechanical
        keyboards tend
        to be monochrome, have either neutral LEDs or no LEDs, and have a normal font on the keycaps.
