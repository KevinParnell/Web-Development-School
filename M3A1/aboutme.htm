    <h2><a id="ACADEMIC">Academic History and Goals:</a></h2>
    <p>
        In my Freshman year and Sophomore year of high school, I attended Jensen Beach High School and took some
        engineering classes, but I had a stronger interest in computer science. My Junior year I transferred to Clark
        Advanced Learning Center where I started taking classes more focused in computer science. I was part of Tech
        Team and was President of Computer Club. I was even nominated for the Pathfinder Award for computer science. I
        dual enrolled at IRSC at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then I went to Florida Polytechnic University for a year, pursuing a degree
        in cyber security, but the school just wasn't meant for me, so I transferred back to IRSC. Right now I am
        currently earning my AS degree in IT, and will decide to either continue my BS in computer science at IRSC or
        finish my degree at a different college. I am taking some applications for business classes as well as a web
        developmet class, a Java class, and a Linux class. Previous semesters I took classes focused on the C and C++
        programming languages, but as of now I'm enjoying Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal is to finish my degree and have a job in the
        computer science field.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="PERSONAL">Personal Interests:</a></h2>
    <p>
        Some personal interests of mine include programming, using Linux and helping with tech support (I run a Linux
        and Technology Discord server), using other operating systems such as macOS and Windows 10, gaming, checking
        out the latest tech, and learning about retro tech.
