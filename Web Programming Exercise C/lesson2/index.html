    </div>

    <p>This is the index (home) page for &quot;Lesson 2&quot; of Exercise C.</p>
    <p>To reach Lesson 1, the relative href would be: <a href='../lesson1/index.html'><code>../lesson1/index.html</code></a></p>
    <p>An image file containing a graphic of a &quot;close&quot; button <img src='closebutton.gif' alt='Close button image'
            width='16' height='14'> has been stored in the same folder as this page, making it easy to reference in the
        src attribute of the img tag by type just its filename. If you view the source code for this page, you will see
        that the images of IRSC logo and the home button are both referred to relatively by prepending the path <code>../images</code>
        ahead of the file names because those files are both located in a folder that is a &quot;sibling&quot; of the
        current folder (containing this page). A sibling is an object that has the same parent object, in this case the
        folder named <code>exercise_b</code>.</p>
