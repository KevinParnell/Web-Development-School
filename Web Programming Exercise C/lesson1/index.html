    <h2><a name="SEC1">Section 1 - Navigation to each lesson</a></h2>
    <!-- the h2 element above contains a named anchor - described in Section 4 below -->
    <p>This is the index (home) page for &quot;Lesson 1&quot; of Exercise C. It acts as an access point for all pages
        related to that lesson. Each folder on a website <em>can</em> have an HTML file named <code>index.htm</code>
        (or <code>.html</code>). The name of this &quot;home page&quot; file depends on the configuration settings of
        the web server hosting the site. That file acts as a table of contents and link launching point for other files
        in that folder (or other locations if needed). If this page was stored on a website at the web address <code>http://www.host.net/exercise_c/lesson1/index.html</code>,
        most servers would serve up this page even if the user typed only the URL <code>http://www.host.net/exercise_c/lesson1/</code>
        leaving off the filename. Note that it is best practice to include the slash following the final folder label (<code>lesson1</code>
        in this example) to indicate that it is a folder name. Most servers will allow this slash to be omitted.</p>

    <h2 id="SEC2">Section 2 - How to link back to the home page</h2>
    <p>The home image at the bottom of this page is nested inside of an HTML anchor element to allow it to server as a
        link back to the home page of Exercise C. Notice that there is no border around the image. This is accomplished
        by embedding a CSS style declaration in the img tag to supress the border. View the source code for this page
        to see this. Also notice the use of the <code>..</code> &quot;parent folder&quot; reference used in the href
        attribute of the anchor tag to ensure that it links to the home page for Exercise C (in the parent folder)
        rather than the home page for the current folder (this file).</p>

    <h2 id="SEC3">Section 3 - How to link to other lessons on this site.</h2>
    <p>Websites often contain many separate related pages.
        Often, these are meant to be read in a specific order. So it is helpful to provide links on each page to both
        the next and previous page in the sequence. In the case of the example site in this exercise (which contains a
        very small sequence of only two lesson pages) this page contains only one link -
        to the other (next) lesson. To reach Lesson 2, the relative href would be: <a href='../lesson2/index.html'><code>../lesson2/index.html</code></a></p>
    <p>On that page, you will see an example of a link that returns to this (its
        previous) page.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="SEC4">Section 4 - How to link to a &quot;named anchor&quot; position on this site.</h2>
    <p>The Exercise C Home Page contains a list of links to the other lesson pages
        on this site. In some cases, a web page might be so long, that it is useful to create named positions within
        that page that can serve as termination points for links from other pages to allow readers to jump to specific
        places within the content without having to start at the top of the page and scroll down until the desired
        content is located. Positions such as these are called &quot;named anchors&quot;. This document contains four
        of them, one located
        at the position of each h2 element on the page. Examine the source code for the h2 heading for Section 1 and
        you will see that it contains a named anchor of SEC1 coded using the &quot;name&quot; attribute of an anchor
        (a) tag. This special type of anchor element serves as the terminal point for a link that
        was initiated elsewhere. You can find the originating anchor for this link on the index page for Exercise C
        labeled &quot;Section 1 - Navigation to each lesson&quot;.</p>
    <p>Examine the source code for the h2 heading for the other sections and you will see that their heading elements
        have been assigned an &quot;id&quot; attribute instead of using an anchor (a) tag. Both coding methods still
        work. But the use of the &quot;id&quot; attribute is now the preferred method because its coding is simpler.
        Regardless of the method used to code the named anchor, the coding of the href attribute within the originating
        anchor is the same. (See the section links on the index page for Exercise C.)</p>
