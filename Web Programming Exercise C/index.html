    </div>
    <hr>
    <p>This is the index (home) page for &quot;Exercise C&quot;, that will act as
        an access point for a practice website consisting of four folders and a variety
        of HTML and image files distributed in those folders. Each folder on a website <em>can</em> have an HTML file
        named <code>index.htm</code> (or <code>.html</code>). The name of this &quot;home page&quot; file depends on
        the configuration settings
        of the web server hosting the site. That file acts as a table of contents and
        link launching point for other files in that folder (or other locations if needed). If this page was stored on
        a website at the web address
        <code>http://www.host.net/exercise_c/index.html</code>, most servers would serve up this page even if the user
        typed only the URL <code>http://www.host.net/exercise_c/</code> leaving off the filename. Note that it is best
        practice to include the slash following the final folder label (<code>exercise_c</code> in this example) to
        indicate that it is a folder name. Most servers will allow this slash to be omitted.</p>
    <p>Select from the links below to view the other pages/sections on this site. Note that you should
        adjust the height of your browser window to be small enough that this page will <em>not</em> fit into
        it without scrolling in order to see the effects of named anchors in those links.</p>
